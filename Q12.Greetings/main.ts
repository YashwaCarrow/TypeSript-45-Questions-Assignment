//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let my_friends : string[] = ["Ophelia","Adrien","Amelia","Tia"];

for (let i=0; i<my_friends.length; i++){
    console.log("Hi "+my_friends[i]+",It been quite a while since school ended let's meet someday.");
};
