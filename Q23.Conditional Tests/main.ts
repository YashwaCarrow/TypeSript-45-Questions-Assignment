//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

let bestGame = "PUBG";

console.log("The best Battle royal game is == PUBG? My prediction is True.");
console.log(bestGame === "PUBG");

console.log("The best Battle royal game is == COD? My prediction is False.");
console.log(bestGame === "COD");

console.log("The best Battle royal game is == Fortnite? My prediction is True.");
console.log(bestGame !== "Fortnite");

console.log("The best Battle royal game is == Freefire? My prediction is False.");
console.log(bestGame === "Freefire");

let bestRaceCar = "Lamborghini Revuelto";

console.log("The best race car is == Lamborghini Revuelto? My prediction is True.");
console.log(bestRaceCar === "Lamborghini Revuelto");

console.log("The best race car is == Audi R8? My prediction is False.");
console.log(bestRaceCar === "Audi R8");

console.log("The best race car is == Mclaren Artura? My prediction is True.");
console.log(bestRaceCar !== "Mclaren Artura");

console.log("The best race car is == Maserati MC20? My prediction is False.");
console.log(bestRaceCar === "Maserati MC20");

let myFavNum = 4;

console.log("My favorite number == 4? My prediction is True.");
console.log(myFavNum === 4 );

console.log("My favorite number == 6? My prediction is False.");
console.log(myFavNum === 6 );
