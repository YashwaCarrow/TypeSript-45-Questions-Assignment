//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function storingCarInfo(manufacturer : string, modelName: string, ...extras: { [key: string]: any }[]): object {
    const carInfo = {
        manufacturer,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...extras)
    };
    return carInfo;
}

const fav_car = storingCarInfo("Porsche","911 GT3", {color : "Black"}, {year : 2024 ,features : ["Apple CarPlay","Cruise control","Aerodynamics and Cooling","Drag Reduction system"]});
console.log(fav_car);
